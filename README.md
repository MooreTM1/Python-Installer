These libraries can be changed based on the userâ€™s needs. Just add or delete the libraries you need in the script.

# How to use
-	1.) First download the script and open it in IDE or Notepad. In the '$libraries' section of it, add or delete any Python library you need.
-	2.) If you changed any in '$libraries', save script. Make sure it has a .ps1 file.
-	3.) Open PowerShell and navigate to the script's location. ex: 'cd "C:\path\to\script"
-	4.) Execute script with '.\python_installer.ps1'
  
# Just in case
Sometimes PowerShell blocks scripts from running due to security reasons. If this happens, run this:

'Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned'

Then type 'Y' to confirm
